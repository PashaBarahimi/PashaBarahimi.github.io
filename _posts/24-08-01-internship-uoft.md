I'm excited to announce that I'll be interning at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca) this summer. I'll be working with [Prof. Fan Long](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~fanl/) on a project related to the analysis of blockchain smart contracts. Details about the project can be found on the [research page](/research/heimdall/).
