I'm excited to announce that I'll be interning at the [Max Planck Institute for Software Systems (MPI-SWS)](https://www.mpi-sws.org) this summer. I'll be working with [Prof. Rupak Majumdar](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~rupak/) on a project related to model checking multithreaded data structures. Details about the project can be found on the [research page](/research/lincheck/).
