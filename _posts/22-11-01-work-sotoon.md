I started working at [Sotoon](https://sotoon.ir) as a Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) in November 2022. Sotoon is a cloud provider that offers a wide range of cloud services, including virtual machines, object storage, and databases, to some of the largest tech companies in Iran. I'm excited to be part of the team and eager to deepen my knowledge of cloud infrastructure and distributed systems.

Previously, in the summer of 2022, I worked as an intern at Sotoon, where I developed an API Gateway responsible for routing requests to the appropriate microservices. For more information about the project, please visit the [project page](/projects/gateway/).
