I’m Pasha Barahimi, currently in my senior year studying computer engineering at the University of Tehran. My love for programming started back in high school, and that passion naturally led me to pursue computer engineering. It’s been an exciting journey, and over the years, I’ve tackled everything from coding challenges to building projects that I’m proud of. If you’re curious, you can check out some of my work on my [Github page](https://github.com/PashaBarahimi).

## Research Interests

I’m particularly drawn to **Distributed Systems, Blockchain, Cryptography and Security & Privacy**. Along the way, I’ve taken some key courses that have fueled my interest:

- Distributed Computing
- Introduction to Cryptocurrencies
- Computer Networks Security

After diving deeper into Computer Networks and Operating Systems during my studies, I found myself increasingly fascinated by how systems work under the hood.

In the summer of 2023, I had the amazing opportunity to intern at the Max Planck Institute for Software Systems (MPI-SWS) in Germany. I worked on Model Checking for multi-threaded programs as part of the TruSt algorithm project. This [experience](/research/lincheck) gave me a deeper understanding of Formal Methods and made me realize how important it is to ensure software works correctly, especially in complex, concurrent environments.

More recently, I contributed to a project on enforcing control flow integrity in Ethereum smart contracts, which involved detecting self-reverting storage slots. This [experience](/research/heimdall) reinforced my interest in blockchain security, particularly in using symbolic execution to verify decentralized applications.

## Hobbies

When I’m not coding, I love watching TV shows and movies. I’m always hunting for new series or films across different genres. It’s a great way to relax, and I also enjoy seeing how stories are told from various angles.

I’m also a big fan of 8-ball pool. Whether I’m playing casually with friends or in a more competitive setting, I enjoy the strategy and focus it takes to master the game. It’s a fun way to clear my mind and challenge myself in a different way.
