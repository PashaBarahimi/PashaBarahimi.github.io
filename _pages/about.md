I am Pasha Barahimi, a senior undergraduate computer engineering student at the University of Tehran. I first started programming in high school and have been passionate about it ever since, which led me to choose computer engineering as my major. My [Github page](https://github.com/PashaBarahimi) is a collection of my projects and assignments, which I have worked on during my studies.

During my studies and my work experience at a cloud provider company, I have gained experience in various fields of computer engineering and became interested in the fields of distributed systems, blockchain, and security.

My other interest is watching TV series and movies, I have watched many TV series and movies in different genres, and I am always looking for new ones to watch.
