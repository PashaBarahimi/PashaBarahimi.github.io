This is a collection of my projects for the Artificial Intelligence course at the University of Tehran, taught by [Dr. Hakimeh Fadaei](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zdY-omQAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Yadollah Yaghoobzadeh](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TvGqaqAAAAAJ&hl=en) in Fall 2022. The repository containing the assignments is available [here](https://github.com/PashaBarahimi/Artificial-Intelligence-Projects) on GitHub.

Assignments:

1. Introduction to AI and Jupyter Notebooks
2. BFS, DFS, IDS, A\*, and Weighted A\* Search Algorithms
3. Equation Builder using Genetic Algorithms
4. Sim Game using Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning
5. News Classification using Naive Bayes
6. KNN, Decision Trees, and Logistic Regression Machine Learning Algorithms
7. Neural Networks (from scratch) for Arabic Handwritten Letters Recognition
8. Neural Networks (using TensorFlow) for CIFAR-10 Image Classification
