This project was developed as part of a group for the Sotoon internship program. Sotoon is a cloud provider that offers a wide range of services, including storage, compute, and networking, to some of the largest tech companies in Iran. The project is an API Gateway responsible for routing requests to the appropriate microservices. Although the project is not open-source, I can provide further details upon request.

## My Responsibilities

1. Implementing fake upstreams and deploying them on Kubernetes using Ansible
2. Implementing rate limiting with Redis
3. Monitoring the gateway with Prometheus and Grafana
4. Enabling live reloading of configurations
