This is a collection of my projects for the Digital Logic Design lab at the University of Tehran, held by [Prof. Zainalabedin Navabi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Vud0kaEAAAAJ&hl=en) in Spring 2022. The repository containing the assignments is available [here](https://github.com/PashaBarahimi/Digital-Logic-Design-Lab-Experiments) on GitHub. All projects were completed in groups of two.

Group members:

- [Misagh Mohaghegh](https://github.com/MisaghM)

## Assignments

1. Clock and Periodic Signal Generation
2. FPGA Realization of a Radix-4 Multiplier
3. Function Generator
4. Accelerator and Wrappers
