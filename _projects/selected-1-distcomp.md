This is a collection of my projects for the Distributed Computing course at the University of Tehran, taught by [Dr. Reza Shojaee](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kWUm_24AAAAJ&hl=en) in Spring 2024. The repository containing the assignments is available [here](https://github.com/PashaBarahimi/Distributed-Computing-Course-Projects/) on GitHub. All projects were completed in groups of four.

## gRPC and ProtoBuf

In this project, we implemented a simple gRPC client-server application with the following methods:

- Unary RPC
- Server Streaming RPC
- Client Streaming RPC
- Bidirectional Streaming RPC

## Concurrency in Go

This project was about implementing a concurrent client-server application with the following features:

- Concurrency
- Synchronization and Data Consistency
- Fairness
- Resource Management
- Logging
- Error Handling
- Cache

## GlusterFS

In this project, we set up a GlusterFS cluster on multiple Xen VMs.
