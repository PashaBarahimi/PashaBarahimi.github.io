I was playing around with some Truth or Dare Telegram bots and decided to make one myself, in order to fix some of the issues existing in the bots I had used. Moreover, I wanted to learn how to make a Telegram bot and practice my C# skills. Unfortunately, although I had a working bot, I couldn't deploy it due to some issues, and the project was left unfinished. Because of this, the repository containing the project is not open to the public. However, I learned a lot from this project, and I'm planning to revisit it in the future to fix the issues and deploy it.
